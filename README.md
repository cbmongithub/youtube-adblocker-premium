## Roadmap

[‚é∑] Lightweight, around ~0.6KB compressed
[‚é∑] Easy to install and use
[‚é∑] Open-source and free
[‚é∑] No tracking or data collection
[X] Blocks All YouTube Ads
[X] Zero dependencies (Script only)
[X] Create a Chrome extension from the bundle with UI, without using a userscript manager)

## Usage

1. Load the extension in Chrome:
  - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
  - Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner
  - Click "Load unpacked" and select the `youtube-adblocker-premium` directory

2. Alternatively, use as a userscript:
  - Install a userscript manager like Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey, or use the Chrome extension
  - Using userscripts chrome extension, add the file, `youtube-adblocker-premium-0.1.0-1.user.js` from the root directory. Copy code, or download and install the script. **This file is a work in progress. It's glitchy while ads run.**
